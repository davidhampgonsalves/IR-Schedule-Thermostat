# ESP8622 based Scheduling IR Thermostat
Drag your heat pump kicking and screaming into the 21st century for under $10.

## Details
Many heat-pumps only support basic, once a day, on / off scheduling and do not support external thermostats.

This project uses an ESP8622, IR LED and a battery to download your thermostat schedule and send updates it to heat pump via IR (just like the remote) as each scheduled temperature change or power event occurs.
